## 1 Call stack

It is a sequence by which functions are executed.

```javascript
function callstack1() {
  console.log("first");
}
function callstack2() {
  callstack1();
  console.log("second");
}
console.log(callstack2());
```

## 2 Primitive Types

 - Boolean type

 - Null type

 - Undefined type

 - Number type

 - BigInt type

 - String type

 - Symbol type

## 3 value types and reference types

```javascript
var x = 10;
var y = "abc";
var a = x;
var b = y;
a = "def";
b = 20;
console.log(x, y, a, b);
```

## 4 Javascript Implicit Coercion

```javascript
a = 3 * "3"; //9
a = 1 + 2 + "1"; // "31"
a = "quick"; // quick
a = a.toUpperCase(); // QUICK
console.log(a);
```

## 5 == vs === vs typeof

```javascript
a = 55 == "55"; // true
b = 55 === "55"; // false
console.log(a, b);
```

## 6 function, scope

```javascript
var studentList = [
  { id: 1, name: "Dan" },
  { id: 2, name: "Harry" },
];
function getStudent(studentID) {
  for (let student of studentList) {
    if (student.id == studentID) {
      return student.name;
    }
  }
}
var nextStudent = getStudent(2);
console.log(nextStudent);
```


```javascript
var a = [
  { id: 1, val: "abc" },
  { id: 2, val: "def" },
];
function bb(c) {
  for (let d of a) {
    if (d.id == c) {
      return d.val;
    }
  }
}
console.log(bb(2));
```


## 7 function declaration & expression

```javascript
console.log(declare(15, 10));
function declare(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
let express = function (a, b) {
  return a - b;
};
console.log(express(15, 10));
```

## 8. IIFE, Modules and Namespaces

```javascript
var result = (function () {
  return "From IIFE";
})();
console.log(result);
```

function expression
```javascript
var l1 = "lffe";
function lf1() {
  console.log(l1);
}
lf1();
```

named function
```javascript
var l2 = function lf2() {
  console.log(l1);
};
l2();
// lf2();

// Modules
// import { sum } from "./lib.js";
// console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // 10
```

## 9. Message Queue and Event Loop

```javascript
function main() {
  console.log("A");
  setTimeout(function display() {
    console.log("B");
  }, 0);
  console.log("C");
}
main();
```

```
Output

    A
    C
    B
```

Another Example same as above just long

```javascript
function el() {
  console.log("a");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("b");
  }, 0);
  ewl(3);
  console.log("c");
}
function ewl(sec) {
  let sss = Date.now(),
    nn = sss;
  while (nn - sss > sec * 1000) {
    sss += 1000;
  }
}
el();
```

A `stack` is an array-like data structure but with some limitations — you can only add items to the back `and` only remove the last item. 

Another example is a pile of plates — you put them on top of each other `and` at any time you can only remove the top one.


## 11. JavaScript Engines

The basic job of a JavaScript engine is to take the JavaScript code that a developer writes and convert it to fast, optimized code that can be interpreted by a browser or even embedded into an application.

So how does this work? This depends, of course, on the engine. The two main engines of interest are WebKit’s JavaScriptCore and Google’s V8 engine because they are leveraged by `NativeScript`. These two engines handle processing code differently.

`Google’s V8 engine`, written in C++, also compiles and executes JavaScript source code, handles memory allocation, and garbage collects leftovers. Its design consists of two compilers that assemble source code directly into machine code.


## 12. Bitwise Operators, Type Arrays and Array Buffers

```
 7 = 111
 6 = 110
 5 = 101
 4 = 100
 3 = 011
 2 = 010
 1 = 001
 0 = 000
```


```javascript
console.log(true && true); // true

```


## 13. DOM and Layout Trees

[DOM from projecttutorials](https://projecttutorials.github.io/javascriptDOM/)



## 14. Factories and Classes

A constructor function is initialized with a number of parameters,
which would be assigned as properties of this, referring to the function itself.
The first letter of the identifier would be capitalized by convention.

process of `initialization`, `adding methods`

```javascript
function Hero(name, level) {
  this.name = name;
  this.level = level;
}

// Adding a method to the constructor
Hero.prototype.greet = function () {
  return `${this.name} says hello.`;
};

// Creating a new constructor from the parent
function Mage(name, level, spell) {
  // Chain constructor with call
  Hero.call(this, name, level);

  this.spell = spell;
}
```


```javascript
const hero1 = new Mage("Lejon", 2, "Magic Missile");
console.log(hero1);

```

`inheritance` of a `constructor function` and a `class`

```javascript
// Initializing a class
class Hero {
  constructor(name, level) {
    this.name = name;
    this.level = level;
  }

  // Adding a method to the constructor
  greet() {
    return `${this.name} says hello.`;
  }
}

// Creating a new class from the parent
class Mage extends Hero {
  constructor(name, level, spell) {
    // Chain constructor with super
    super(name, level);

    // Add a new property
    this.spell = spell;
  }
}
```

`Base Classes`: `Declarations` and `Expressions`

```javascript
// Student is a base class
class Student {
  constructor(name, id) {
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
  }
  getDetails() {
    return `Name: ${this.name} \n Id: ${this.id}`;
  }
  print() {
    console.log(this.getDetails());
  }
}
let s1 = new Student("Petrov", 25094);
s1.print();           // Name: Petrov  Id: 25094
console.log(s1.id);   // 25094
```


## 15. this, call, apply and bind

### call

```javascript
function a(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
function b(name, age) {
  a.call(this, name, age);
  this.gender = "m";
}
console.log(new b("dan", 1));
d = new b("larry", 2);
console.log(d.name);
```

Output

```
  b { name: 'dan', age: 1, gender: 'm' }
  larry
```

### bind

The `bind()` method creates a new function that, when called, has its `this` keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.


```javascript
const module = {
  x: 42,
  getX: function() {
    return this.x;
  }
};

const unboundGetX = module.getX;
console.log(unboundGetX()); // The function gets invoked at the global scope
// expected output: undefined

const boundGetX = unboundGetX.bind(module);
console.log(boundGetX());
// expected output: 42
```

Another straightforward example

```javascript
const a = {
  aa: 1,
  b: function () {
    return this.aa;
  },
};

const c = a.b;
console.log(c());

const d = c.bind(a);
console.log(d());
```

### apply

The apply() method calls the specified function with a given this value, and arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object).


```javascript
const numbers = [5, 6, 2, 3, 7];

const max = Math.max.apply(null, numbers);

console.log(max);
// expected output: 7

const min = Math.min.apply(null, numbers);

console.log(min);
// expected output: 2
```


## 16. new, Constructor, instanceof and Instances

### new

```javascript
function User(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.isAdmin = false;
}

let user = new User("Jack");

console.log(user.name); // Jack
console.log(user.isAdmin); // false
```


## 17. Prototype Inheritance and Prototype Chain

### __proto__
All JavaScript objects have a prototype. Browsers implement prototypes through the __proto__ property and this is how we’ll refer to it. This is often called the dunder proto, short for double underscore prototype. Don’t EVER reassign this property or use it directly. The MDN page for __proto__ warns us in big red blocks to never do this.

### prototype
Functions also have a prototype property. This is distinct from their __proto__ property. This makes discussion rather confusing, so I’ll spell out the syntax I’ll be using. When I refer to a prototype and the word “prototype” isn’t highlighted grey, I’m referring to the __proto__ property. When I use prototype in grey, I’m talking about a function’s prototype property.

### Inheritance
Inheritance refers to an object’s ability to access methods and other properties from another object. Objects can inherit things from other objects. Inheritance in JavaScript works through something called prototypes and this form of inheritance is often called prototypal inheritance.

```javascript
var obj = {};
console.log(obj.__proto__);
// -> {constructor: ƒ, __defineGetter__: ƒ, …}
```


```javascript
function Fn() {}
var obj = new Fn();

console.log(obj.__proto__ === Fn.prototype);
// -> true

console.log(obj.__proto__.__proto__=== Object.prototype);
// -> true

console.log(obj.__proto__.__proto__.__proto__ === null);
// -> true
```


## 18. Object.create and Object.assign

### create
The `Object.create()` method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.


```javascript
const a = {
  isHuman: false,
  print: function () {
    console.log(`I am ${this.name}.\nRobot status: ${this.isHuman}`);
  },
};

const b = Object.create(a);

b.name = "John";
b.isHuman = true;
b.print();
```

### assign
The `Object.assign()` method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the modified target object.


```javascript
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };

const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

console.log(target);
// expected output: Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }

console.log(returnedTarget);
// expected output: Object { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }
```


## 19. map, reduce, filter

### map()
The `map()` method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling `array`.

```javascript
const a = [1, 2, 3];
const b = a.map((x) => x * 2);
console.log(b);
//[ 2, 4, 6 ]
```

### filter()
The `filter()` method creates a shallow copy of a portion of a given array, filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

```javascript
const words = [
  "spray",
  "limit",
  "elite",
  "exuberant",
  "destruction",
  "present",
];

const result = words.filter((word) => word.length < 6);

console.log(result);
// [ 'spray', 'limit', 'elite' ]
```

### map()
The `reduce()` method executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.

```javascript
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
const initialValue = 0;
const sumWithInitial = array1.reduce(
  (previousValue, currentValue) => previousValue + currentValue,
  initialValue
);

console.log(sumWithInitial);
// expected output: 10
```

## 21. Closures

A `closure` is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In   , closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.


### Lexical scoping

```javascript
function init() {
  var name = 'Mozilla'; // name is a local variable created by init
  function displayName() {
    // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
    console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
  }
  displayName();
}
init();
```


## 22. High Order Functions

If you’ve done much JavaScript web development, you’ve probably come across functions that use a callback.

A callback function is a function that executes at the end of an operation, once all other operations are complete.

Usually, we pass this function as an argument last, after other parameters. It’s often defined inline as an anonymous function. Callback functions rely on JavaScript’s ability to deal with higher-order functions.

JavaScript is a single-threaded language. This means only one operation can execute at a time.

To avoid operations blocking each other or the system’s main thread (which would cause deadlock), the engine ensures all operations execute in order. They’re queued along this single thread until it’s safe for another transaction of code to occur.

The ability to pass in a function as an argument and run it after the parent function’s other operations are complete is essential for a language to support higher-order functions.

Callback functions in JavaScript allow for asynchronous behavior, so a script can continue executing other functions or operations while waiting for a result.

The ability to pass a callback function is critical when dealing with resources that may return a result after an undetermined period of time.

This higher-order function pattern is very useful in a web development. A script may send a request off to a server, and then need to handle the response whenever it arrives, without requiring any knowledge of the server’s network latency or processing time.

Node.js frequently uses callback functions to make efficient use of server resources. This asynchronous approach is also useful in the case of an app that waits for user input before performing a function. [read more](https://www.sitepoint.com/higher-order-functions-javascript/)

## 23. Recursion

**Loosely defined**, recursion is the process of `taking a big problem` and `sub-dividing` it into multiple, smaller instances of the same problem.

`Recursion` is a technique for iterating over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result. Most loops can be rewritten in a `recursive style`, and in some functional languages this approach to looping is the default.



## 24. Collections and Generators

The `Generator` object is returned by a generator function and it conforms to both the iterable protocol and the iterator protocol.


## 25. Promises

The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

### Description

A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.[read more](https://hackernoon.com/understanding-promises-in-javascript-13d99df067c1?ref=hackernoon.com)



## 26. async/await

Async and Await are extensions of `promises`

Inside a function marked as async, you are allowed to place the await keyword in front of an expression that returns a Promise. When you do, the execution is paused until the Promise is resolved.

Before we dive into it, let’s take a moment to familiarize you with the async/await style. First, async/await makes the asynchronous code appear and behave like synchronous code. Being that it was built on top of Promises, you could simply see it as a new way of writing synchronous code. Just like Promises themselves, async/await is equally non-blocking.

The purpose of async/await functions is to simplify the behavior of using Promises synchronously and to perform some behavior on a group of Promises. Just as Promises are similar to structured callbacks, one can say that async/await is similar to combining generators and Promises.
